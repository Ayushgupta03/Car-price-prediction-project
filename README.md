## Overview
This is a Car cost prediction application deployed on Heroku using Flask.The dataset is collected from Kaggle and model is trained using random forest regressor.

## Motivation
Just like every begineer in the field of ML/DL, I used to download datasets and leave the projects after training them but over the time, I understood that one should also focus on the deployment of the project or i say end to end development of a project.Because if anyone want to see your project, he/sge would first interact with the interface of you project and later go on backend.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two major parts:
1. Playing with Dataset which includes cleaning, Data visualization, Feature importance and training using the appropriate model.
2. Second part is development of Flask app (Back-end in python and Front-end using html) and hosting it on Heroku.
